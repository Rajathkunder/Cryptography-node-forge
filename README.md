# Cryptography-node-forge
In this we are actually performing cryptographic operations using node-forge, ie we are generating private and public key , and then we will take an user input.
we will encrypt the user input with the help of public key and RSA-OAEP algorithm so that an encrypted text will be generated.
After that we will pass that Encrypted text and private key with RSA-OAEP algorithm to another file , so that finally we can view decrypted text ie original text.

You can refer Workflow.txt file for more details inside zrpl-test folder
