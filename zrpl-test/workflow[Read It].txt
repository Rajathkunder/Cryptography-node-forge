				DETAILED WORKFLOW
				---------------------------------
1. *In the file api-key-gen.js first of all we are importing necessary packages like node-forge which contain all cryptographic utilities,
      next is file system module for reading or writing files, and atlast path module.
    *Next we will  generate a new RSA key pair using the Forge library, in this case it will generate a 2048-bit key.
      The private key is then extracted from the key pair and converted to PEM format using the forge.pki.privateKeyToPem() method.
       In the same way  the public key is extracted from the key pair and converted to PEM format using the forge.pki.publicKeyToPem() method.
     *Next we will specify the directory or path where we need to store that key,also we write all contents ie keys to a seperate html file ie key-gen.html.
2.  *The key-gen.html file contains the private as well as public key.
3.  *In encrypt.js file we are actually encrypting the uer-input using public key, so we are reading the public key from key-gen.html file , 
       we use regex inorder to exactly read the public key .The forge.pki.publicKeyFromPem function then parses the PEM-encoded public key and returns a PublicKey object.
      *Next the publicKey.encrypt(input, 'RSA-OAEP') method encrypts the input string using the RSA-OAEP algorithm with the public key.
        then we will write that encrypted text to result.html file with base64 encoding.
4.   *In decrypt.js file we are taking the private key from key-gen.html file and encrypted text from result.html file and then we decrypting it.
      *In this the forge.pki.privateKeyFromPem function then parses the PEM-encoded privte key and returns a Privatekey object, also we willl read and store the encrypted text from result.html file.
      *we will use the forge.util.decode64() function to decode the message from base64 encoding.
      *And then we will decrypt the message using private and RSA-OAEP algorithm.

				HOW TO RUN
				-------------------
step1: First of all you need node.js dev env
step2: Install  Cryptographic utilities like 'node-forge' also install 'fs' and 'path' modules.
step3:Run command "node api-key-gen.js" , you can see a key-gen.html file is generated in key-pair directory;
step4: Once you have private and public key , Try to encrypt some string ie Run command "node encrypt.js sample-text"[Here sample-text is commandline argument].
          you can see a result.html file is generated with some encrypted text.
step5:Finally , Inorder to decrypt this encrypted text Run command "node decrypt.js" , you can observe the output ie input text.
